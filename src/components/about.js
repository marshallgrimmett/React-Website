        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi there! I'm a full stack developer from New York.</p>
        <p>I'm in my final year at the University at Albany and I study Computer Science
          and Applied Mathematics.
        </p>
        <p>I enjoy learning new and exciting technologies!
          I am currently learning to build web apps using React, Redux, Node.js, and Express.
        </p>
        <p>
          I never considered web development until I started learning about Single
          Page Apps (SPAs) and Progressive Web Apps (PWAs). I have always wanted to create apps
          of some kind and the web gives me the ability to develop powerful apps for all
          platforms.
        </p>
      </div>
